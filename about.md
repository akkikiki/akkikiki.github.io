I am currently a search engineer at Amazon Japan and its subsidary A9.com.

My main interest is on Natural Language Processing, especially on cross-lingual processing such as Japanese or other Asian languages. Japanese (or Chinese, Korean, etc.) is an unsegmented language and this fact makes it difficult to tokenize (word segmentation and POS-tagging) when compared to English.
