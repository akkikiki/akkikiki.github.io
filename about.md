title: About
---

I am an incoming computer science PhD student at University of Colorado, Boulder.
I was previously a search engineer at Amazon Japan and its subsidiary A9.com. My Japanese name is "藤沼祥成". 

My main interest is on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. On the method side, I am intersted in unsupervised/semi-supervised/distant-supervised learning, or making use of unlabeled data because it requires less human burden. On the application side, I am interested in cross-lingual processing on Japanese or other Asian languages. Japanese (or Chinese, Korean, etc.) is an unsegmented language and this fact makes it difficult to tokenize (word segmentation and POS-tagging) when compared to English.
